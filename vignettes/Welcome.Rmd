We're going to have a great semester using R. This document is called a "vignette." It's a way of describing what you need to do to setup the software you're using.

## Starting up

When you first open R, give this command:

```{r eval = FALSE}
MAT160::startup()
```

I know the empty `()` looks strange, but there's a reason why it has to be there.
